# Database and Like System Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Database Error: "relation 'travel_stories' does not exist"
**Problem**: The `travel_stories` table was not created in the database, causing the `add_story_comment` function to fail.

**Solution Applied**:
- Created comprehensive migration `20250625180000_fix_database_and_likes.sql`
- Ensures `travel_stories` table exists with all required columns
- Added proper indexes and RLS policies
- Fixed database functions to work with existing schema

### 2. Like System Issue: Users can like posts multiple times
**Problem**: No tracking of which users liked which posts, allowing unlimited likes per user.

**Solution Applied**:
- Created `story_likes` table with unique constraint `(user_id, story_id)`
- Added database functions:
  - `like_story()` - Adds like with duplicate prevention
  - `unlike_story()` - Removes like with validation
  - `user_liked_story()` - Checks if user liked a story
  - `get_user_liked_stories()` - Returns array of liked story IDs
- Updated frontend to use proper user tracking

## Database Schema Changes

### New Tables Created:
```sql
-- story_likes: Tracks unique user likes per story
CREATE TABLE story_likes (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  story_id UUID REFERENCES travel_stories(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(user_id, story_id) -- One like per user per story
);
```

### New Database Functions:
1. **like_story(story_id, user_id)** - Safely add like with duplicate checking
2. **unlike_story(story_id, user_id)** - Safely remove like with validation
3. **user_liked_story(story_id, user_id)** - Check if user liked story
4. **get_user_liked_stories(user_id)** - Get all stories liked by user
5. **add_story_comment()** - Fixed to work with travel_stories table
6. **get_story_comments()** - Fixed pagination and JSONB handling

## Frontend Changes

### TravelStoriesService Updates:
- `toggleLike()` now requires `(storyId, userId, isCurrentlyLiked)`
- Added `hasUserLikedStory()` function
- Added `getUserLikedStories()` function
- Improved error handling and response processing

### ExplorePage Updates:
- Loads user's liked stories on component mount
- Uses proper like tracking with database validation
- Prevents duplicate likes through UI state management
- Shows accurate like counts from database
- Handles like/unlike failures gracefully

## Key Features:

### ‚úÖ **Unique Like System**:
- Each user can like each story only once
- Database enforces uniqueness with constraint
- UI prevents double-clicking and shows accurate state

### ‚úÖ **Robust Error Handling**:
- Handles "already liked" and "not liked" scenarios
- Refreshes UI state when database operations fail
- Clear console logging for debugging

### ‚úÖ **Performance Optimized**:
- Efficient database functions with minimal queries
- Proper indexing on `story_likes` table
- Caching and request deduplication maintained

### ‚úÖ **Data Integrity**:
- Automatic sync between `likes_count` and actual likes
- Prevents negative like counts
- Maintains referential integrity with foreign keys

## üö® **CRITICAL: Apply This Migration Now**

**Your database tables don't exist yet!** You MUST run this migration:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard** ‚Üí **SQL Editor**
2. **Copy and paste the ENTIRE contents** of:
   ```
   supabase/migrations/20250625181000_fix_function_compilation.sql
   ```
3. **Click "Run"** to execute the migration

**‚ö†Ô∏è Without this migration, the app won't work!**

2. **Verify the fixes**:
   ```sql
   -- Check tables exist:
   SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
   WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
   AND table_name IN ('travel_stories', 'story_likes');

   -- Check functions exist:
   SELECT routine_name FROM information_schema.routines 
   WHERE routine_schema = 'public' 
   AND routine_name IN ('like_story', 'unlike_story', 'user_liked_story');
   ```

3. **Test the functionality**:
   - Login to the app
   - Try liking a travel story (should work once)
   - Try liking the same story again (should be prevented)
   - Unlike the story (should work)
   - Refresh page (like state should persist)

## Expected Behavior:

### Before Fix:
- ‚ùå Database errors when commenting
- ‚ùå Users could like stories unlimited times
- ‚ùå No persistence of like state
- ‚ùå Inaccurate like counts

### After Fix:
- ‚úÖ Comments work properly
- ‚úÖ Users can like each story only once
- ‚úÖ Like state persists across sessions
- ‚úÖ Accurate like counts from database
- ‚úÖ Proper error handling and user feedback

## Security Features:

- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Users can only manage their own likes
- **Unique Constraints**: Database prevents duplicate likes
- **Foreign Key Constraints**: Maintains data integrity
- **Parameterized Queries**: Prevents SQL injection
- **Proper Authentication**: All operations require valid user ID

This implementation ensures a robust, scalable like system that maintains data integrity while providing excellent user experience.
