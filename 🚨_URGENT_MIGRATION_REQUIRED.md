# 🚨 URGENT: DATABASE MIGRATION REQUIRED

## ❌ **Current Status: App Not Working**

Your app is showing these errors because **database tables don't exist**:
- `relation "travel_stories" does not exist`
- `relation "story_likes" does not exist` 
- `404 (Not Found)` for database functions

## ✅ **Fix: Apply This Migration NOW**

### Step 1: Go to Supabase
1. Open [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Go to **SQL Editor** (left sidebar)

### Step 2: Run the Migration
1. **Copy the ENTIRE contents** of this file:
   ```
   supabase/migrations/20250625181000_fix_function_compilation.sql
   ```
2. **Paste into SQL Editor**
3. **Click "Run"** button

### Step 3: Verify Success
After running the migration, these should work:
- ✅ Like stories (once per user)
- ✅ Add comments to stories
- ✅ No database errors in console

## 📁 **File Location**
The migration file is located at:
```
D:\Hackathon\frontend-repo\supabase\migrations\20250625181000_fix_function_compilation.sql
```

## ⏰ **This Takes 30 Seconds**
The migration creates:
- `travel_stories` table (with comments)
- `story_likes` table (unique user tracking)
- Database functions for like/unlike/comments
- Proper indexes and security policies

## 🆘 **Need Help?**
If you get any errors:
1. Check if you're in the correct Supabase project
2. Make sure you have admin permissions
3. Try running the migration in smaller sections if needed

**After migration: Your app will work perfectly! 🎉**
